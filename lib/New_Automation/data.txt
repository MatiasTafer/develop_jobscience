*********** USERS ************
users.rb have hardcoded users that needs to be created or replaced


*********** ORG SETTINGS ***********
JOB BOARD SETUP detail page: you must add the "Notes and Attachments" related list.


*********** PAGE: requisitions_new_and_edit.rb ***********

PRIMARY_RECRUITER_TEXT = put here an existing user name on your org



Special Notes:
- We notice that in the AUTOMATION ORG the following tabs has different names in the orgs.
In order to proceed with the migration, I renamed them to the same name in  Naomi's org, so:
Naomi's Org: "Accounts" is displayed as "Companies" in Automation org, renamed to "Accounts"
Naomi's Org: "Contacts" is displayed as "Candidates" in Automation org, renamed to "Contacts"

- Contacts detail page needs to have the following buttons:
-- Button: Add skills
-- Button: Apply to job
-- Button: Add to List

- Contacts detail page needs the following related lists:
-- skills related list to contact detail page
-- education history to contacts detail page
-- employment history to contacts detail page
-- Applications, add column "Application" to the related list
